Summary: Reflections on joining an open source project



I decided to contribute to the PeerLibrary open source project. I have been involved in the Open Access movement here in Berkeley so I chose this project from all the other options that existed. After having learnt all these amazing methods to ask meaningful questions to make a foray into open source communities, I was really sad that I couldn't apply any of those methods to get accepted into the PeerLibrary community, because I was approached directly by one of the members directly when I was in class. So the process of just joining the community was pretty informal. The next steps I took were to join the mailing list http://lists.peerlibrary.org/lists/info/dev, and fork the github repository https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary to set up a local running version of Peer Library.

The barriers I faced was that the wiki for the project on github was not very descriptive about the setup and the steps for installation were in the wrong order. Anna Swigart and I were working together and she decided to contribute by editing the Wiki and putting the steps in the right order. I also found that during the setup, we were not able to successfully cache all the papers that existed in the library so I logged an issue in the issue tracker on Github. (https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary/issues/93).  Iâ€™m currently familiarizing myself with the system using the wiki and trying to understand the process of contribution from the guidelines provided on the email list archive (http://lists.peerlibrary.org/lists/arc/dev/2013-09/msg00002.html). 

I think my experience of joining the community was very formal but my experience of familiarizing myself with the system and contributing is very formal.
